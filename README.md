# FINE3300 – Assignment 1

## Project Details
This project has two parts:

1. **Mortgage Payments (`mortgage.py`)**  
   - Calculates mortgage payments for different payment frequencies (monthly, semi-monthly, bi-weekly, weekly, accelerated bi-weekly, accelerated weekly).  
   - Uses the quoted annual fixed interest rate (semi-annual compounding), principal amount, and amortization period.  

2. **Exchange Rates (`exchange.rates.py`)**  
   - Reads the Bank of Canada CSV file to get the latest USD/CAD exchange rate.  
   - Converts between USD and CAD in both directions.  

Both parts can be run directly from the terminal.
